/* ============================================================
   The black box — what was happening just before it broke.

   A freeze destroys its own evidence. The screen stops, the learner reloads
   to get out of it, and whatever threw goes with the page: no console open,
   no stack, nothing left to send anyone. So this file runs before every other
   script on the page — an error thrown while a data file is still parsing is
   exactly the one nothing else would be alive to catch — and it writes what
   it sees straight to localStorage, which reloading cannot reach.

   Two runs are kept: the one that broke and the one after it. "It got stuck,
   I reloaded, and it was still wrong" is one story and needs both halves.

   What goes in is breadcrumbs and errors — which card, which view, which
   button — and never the answers or the kana studied. This is a trail
   through the code, not a copy of the lesson.
